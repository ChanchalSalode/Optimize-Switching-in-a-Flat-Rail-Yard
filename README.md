# Optimizing Train Marshalling with Shunter in a Flat Rail Yard

This repository contains the flat yard marshalling software, instance generator code, and generated instances used to optimize train marshalling in flat rail yards. The marshalling yard plays a critical role in freight train transportation, where trains are reassembled into new outbound trains. Our work focuses on minimizing shunting time by optimizing the marshalling process using a shunter engine.

## Key Features:
- **Two Mathematical Models:** 
  - FYMP1
  - FYMP2
- **Optimization Algorithm:** 
  - An iterative optimization algorithm that finds the optimal number of time points required for efficient shunting.
- **Instance Generator:** 
  - Generates initial block configurations with varying difficulty levels for testing.
- **Software Application:** 
  - Solves marshalling problems using the proposed models and algorithms.

## How to Use:
1. **Instance Generator:** Create new instances by running the instance generator code.
2. **Optimization Software:** Solve the generated instances using the flat yard marshalling software provided.

Feel free to explore the repository and use the provided tools to enhance the efficiency of rail yard operations.
